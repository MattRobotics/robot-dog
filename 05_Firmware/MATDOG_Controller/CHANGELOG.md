# MATDOG Controller — Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-15

First unified operational ESP32-S3 runtime. Integration milestone: brings ST3215
ServoBus, BNO085 IMU, DALY BMS telemetry and a new LED ring module into one modular,
deployable firmware image with a shared USB diagnostic surface, cooperative
non-blocking scheduling, module health aggregation and a power-state machine
baseline.

- `core`: `Controller`, `SystemState`, `PowerState`, `CommandRouter`.
- `servo`: `ServoBus` — read-only ST3215 transport adapted from the frozen Bench QC
  V6.1 source; `@SERVO SAFE_OFF` is the only write, torque-off only.
- `imu`: `Bno085Imu` — adapted from `matdog_bno085_dcd_phase_c3`; preserves the
  viewer-required `RV`/`MAG`/`GYR`/`COUNTS`/`SAVE_GATE` text protocol exactly; no
  DCD-save path exists in this firmware at all.
- `power`: `DalyBms` — adapted from `matdog_daly_rs485_probe_v2`; non-blocking poll
  state machine; `requestDischargeOff()` is a fail-closed placeholder pending K-Series
  write-protocol verification.
- `status`: `LedRing` — new module (no prior MATDOG source existed), built on
  Adafruit NeoPixel 1.15.5; boots OFF, brightness capped well under hardware maximum.
- Scope explicitly excludes gait, operational IK, closed-loop stabilization, ROS 2,
  Wi-Fi/OTA, autonomous behaviour, automatic calibration and any DALY/servo/BNO085
  write beyond the ones listed above.

See `SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md` for exact source hashes and `VALIDATION.md` for what has
and has not been exercised on real hardware.

## 0.1.0 — Session 2 hardening — 2026-09-15

Corrective/procedural hardening on top of the same 0.1.0 scope above — no new
firmware functionality, no motion/gait/IK/DALY-write/KEY work. Flashed and
hardware-validated as commit `04dfa52d1b5ab37ac4099792bb8c874c5ee4842a`
(`FIRMWARE_SOURCE_COMMIT`; see `VALIDATION.md` Session 2 for why this document's
own commit is necessarily later and must not be confused with it).

- `core`: adds `Availability` (`InitializationState`/`DetectedState`/
  `ExpectedState` → `Classification`), fixing `@STATUS` reporting a module as
  `OK` merely because its driver initialized rather than because the hardware
  was actually detected. `Controller::update()` now drives `ServoBus::update()`
  every tick.
- `status/LedRing`: no longer initializes the NeoPixel transport or transmits
  any WS2812 frame while `build::kLedRailPowered` is false (current `USB_ONLY`
  profile) — GPIO47 is left in a defined `INPUT` state instead. `@LED TEST`
  now refuses explicitly rather than driving an unpowered rail.
- `servo/ServoBus`: `@SERVO SCAN` is now a non-blocking one-`Ping()`-per-tick
  state machine instead of a synchronous loop that could monopolize `loop()`
  for seconds against an unresponsive ID range.
- `scripts/`: adds `flash_app_only.sh` (writes only the verified active
  application/OTA partition, never bootloader/partition-table/boot_app0) and
  `verify_application_partition.py` (reads the device's own partition table +
  otadata rather than assuming an offset). Corrects `upload.sh`'s header
  comment, which had incorrectly described a full Arduino upload as
  application-only.
- `scripts/static_audit.py`: four new regression checks for the above.

See `VALIDATION.md` Session 2 for the full read-only flash audit, the
application-only flash provenance record, and H1–H6 hardware results.
